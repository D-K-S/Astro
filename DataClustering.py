runs the DBScan clustering algorithm on data from dataTuple
epsilon needs to be set and min_samples = 2* %number_of_dimensions
data is scaled before running the algorithm
Algorithm is called on epsilon, epsilon-interval and epsilon+interval, this was added due to rough estimation of epsilon with knn distance graph 
If the algorithm was already run with that epsilon it is loaded from a file, epsilon is saved to three digit precision
Function returns a list of labels found by algorithm for inputed data
It also prints epsilon value used, number of clusters found (not including noise) and number of stars for all clusters which have >= 50 points
50 is chosen as boundary in order to eliminate some noise from data, typical size of cluster is 100+ 
NOTE: Make sure to change directories when changing data, otherwise data might become corrupted due to load/save method
